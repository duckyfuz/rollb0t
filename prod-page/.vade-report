## Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for the Next.js project using the App Router.

### Changes Made

**Created/Modified Files:**
- Modified: `app/layout.tsx` - Added Analytics component import and integration

**Package Updates:**
- Added: `@vercel/analytics@^1.4.0` (latest stable version)
- Updated: `package-lock.json` - Lock file updated with new dependency

### Implementation Details

1. **Package Installation**: 
   - Installed `@vercel/analytics` using npm (the project's package manager)
   - Added 364 new packages as dependencies

2. **Analytics Component Integration**:
   - Imported Analytics from '@vercel/analytics/next' at the top of app/layout.tsx
   - Added `<Analytics />` component inside the body tag, after {children}
   - This placement ensures analytics are tracked across all routes in the App Router

3. **Code Structure Preserved**:
   - All existing imports, metadata configuration, and styling remain unchanged
   - Analytics component is non-intrusive and doesn't affect page rendering
   - Follows Next.js and Vercel best practices

### Verification Steps Completed

✓ Build completed successfully with no errors
✓ TypeScript compilation passed
✓ ESLint checks passed with no warnings or errors
✓ All pages generated correctly during build
✓ Package lock file properly updated

### Notes

- The project uses the Next.js App Router (v16.1.3) with app/ directory structure
- Analytics will automatically track user interactions and page views
- The Analytics component is a client component that communicates with Vercel's analytics service
- No additional configuration files needed - works out of the box with Vercel deployments
